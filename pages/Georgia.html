                    <li>We spent four glorious hours on the beach, then tried to find lunch.  We ended up back in Savannah at Paula Deen's restaurant where we were introduced to butter cake.  It was delicious. </li>

                    <li>It is located on the Ogeechee River and protected Savannah from the Union Army during the Civil War. </li>
                    <li>Bombs from Union ships could heavily damage it, but because it was made from the earth, it was easily repaired.</li>
